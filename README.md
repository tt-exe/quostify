# Quostify v1

Creating posts has never been this easy and beautiful

Simply used [4skinSkywalker's Database-Quotes-JSON](https://github.com/4skinSkywalker/Database-Quotes-JSON) along with Unsplash API to generate 1080x1080 posts for social media use ...

## What it actually does
* Gets a picture from Unsplash via the API
* Detects its average color temperature via a custom algorithm
* Applies a low-opacity filter for a more cinematic effect
* Writes quote on top with one of two colors depending on the color temperature


## Changelog

* Pure Html and Css as of now, jQuery and ajax to parse quotes from a local json file
* Custom algorithms to fetch and print on canvas
* Basic ergonomic UI
